A file must be opened before the data insid
e it can be read into your program. The buil
t in open path function will open and return the f
ile at the specified path. You may use an absolute path 
or a path that is relative to your programs working direc
tory. By default the working directory is the directory 
from which your program is executed. We have used sequenc
es in our programs many times. ○Strings are sequences of
characters. Ranges are sequences of integers. A text fi
le can be treated as though it is a sequence of lines. ○E
ach line is a string of text. Like the other sequences t
hat we have used, a file will work with a for loop. ○At 
the beginning of each iteration, the next line of text i
n the file is assigned to the loop variable. The loop w
ill terminate when the end of the file is reached. Unlik
e other sequences, you cannot use the operator to rando
mly access lines.
